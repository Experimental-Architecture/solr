# Apache Solr instance

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Services-Sandbox/solr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Services-Sandbox/solr)


For more information about this project-repository, the [documentation can be found here](https://apache-solr-search.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the readme file will contain summaries of each portion of the project. For official documentation of the libraries used in this project, please consult the table as follows:

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/--) | This is the main engine that will index the contents and store in the elgg-core directory within the data folder. Solr must have access to this core in order to store index and log warnings and errors. The configuration file is located within the solr-configuration-files directory.|
| [Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#prerequisites) |    This instance has been configured to run inside a Docker container that contains all the dependencies and libraries that are used. The Dockerfile can be found in docker-configuration-files. |
| [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/?path=users&persona=app-developer&level=foundational) |  Still in process to be worked on, but there are configuration files for Kubernetes deployment developed, it can be found in the kubernetes-configuration-files directory. |

## Getting Started -- Installation

### Directories Explained

| directory | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| docker-configuration-files | contains the Dockerfile needed to create and run the container for Solr |
| docs | contains the documentation for the entire project, it is currently hosted and can be viewed [here](https://apache-solr-search.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) |
| elgg-plugin | contains the plugin that can be installed on an elgg instance, it basically generates REST API that retrieves all the contents and displays it in json format |
| kubernetes-configuration-files | contains all the files required to run the project in a pod |
| search-portal-app | contains the reactjs project that formats the search results thats retrieved from solr |
| solr-configuration-files | contains the groovy scripts that will be run for indexing and the core that will be used to organize the index |

### (Optional) Manual Installation, without Docker or Kubernetes

The following needs to be installed:
- elgg

   You just need an instance of Elgg so that we have something we can crawl. The plugin for this to work is in the ```elgg-plugin``` directory which also require ```web services``` to be enabled on elgg. This basically generates REST API for the indexing portion of this project. Will require LAMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack to be installed for this application. Please read up on the documentation for [elgg installation](http://learn.elgg.org/en/2.0/intro/install.html).

- reactjs

   A ReactJS project is also included in this repository in the ```search-portal-app```, so we can test the resultset that gets retrieved from Apache Solr. Please consult the **[Minimum Viable Product - Search Portal](https://github.com/Services-Sandbox/solr#optional-minimum-viable-product---search-portal)** section on installation and running the app.

- apache solr

   The meat of the repository, it just contains the configuration files. You may need to create the index folder and give the user read and write access to the entire configuration directory since the engine will be creating and modifying log files and indexes. 

   ```
   # in your home directory, download the solr package from their official site and unzip
   $ wget http://httpd-mirror.sergal.org/apache/lucene/solr/7.3.0/solr-7.3.0.tgz --no-proxy -q
   $ tar -xf solr-7.3.0.tgz 
   $ mv solr-7.3.0 solr && mv solr /opt/

   # move the configuration file (that is included in this repository) to the solr engine
   $ mv elgg-core /opt/solr/server/solr/

   # on an instance of linux, the solr app files are all located within /opt/solr/
   $ cd /opt/solr/bin

   # start the solr app using the solr user (this is recommended), unless you run root, then you will be required to add the flag -force
   $ sudo -u solr solr start
   $ sudo ./solr start -force

   Waiting up to 180 seconds to see Solr running on port 8983 [-]
   Started Solr server on port 8983 (pid=22624). Happy searching!
   ```

- apache groovy

   This is a scripting mechanism that you can run on a daily basis using crontab (linux) or scheduleder (windows), this can be found in the directory called ```solr-configuration-files```.

   ```
   # installation
   $ curl -s get.sdkman.io | bash
   $ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
   $ sdk install groovy

   # running groovy scripts
   $ groovy script-name-here.groovy
   ```


### (Optional) Minimum Viable Product - Search Portal

This is optional, if you like to design how the results should be displayed you can use this small NodeJS site application that request and retrieves to display the result set onto the page. Since it is developed in NodeJS, it is fully dynamic. 

To get started with the ReachJS application, you need to be in the search-portal directory.

```
# install package management
$ apt install npm

# install nodejs
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
$ sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
$ apt-get install nodejs
$ npm -v

# compile the code
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ create-react-app search-portal
$ cd search-portal/

# start the application
$ npm start

# to import libraries, they must be in the npm repository
$ npm install --save react-fontawesome
```

## Running Groovy Scripts as your indexer

```
# running groovy scripts
$ groovy your-groovy-script.groovy

# configure the crontab to run the groovy script every so often
$ crontab -e
```

File: /tmp/crontab

```
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command

* * * * * groovy your-groovy-script.groovy

```

## Using Docker

Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join --token 3e0a6b.501f5895e6e1a9df 192.168.1.65:6443 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:ae12de632770aa36c88cf33ae0f64a6400362a321d88a21e3612adc7a84e40b2


$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

# remove existing configuration, this may cause problem later on
$ rm /root/.kube/config

$ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
$ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
